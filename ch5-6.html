                <li><strong>RAM:</strong> This defines Computer memory uses an access technique called random access memory. This is a type of volatile memory that causes the information to disappear when the power is turned off. 
                    Without some type of long-term, nonvolatile memory, information could not be saved between shutdowns of the machine. </li>

                <li><strong>cache:</strong> A temporary high-speed memory unit that keeps a copy of memory cells are likely to be used again in the near future.</li>

                <li><strong>Principle of locality: The high likelihood that when a program fetches a piece of data or an instruction:</strong></li>
            <ol>
                <li>It will access that same instruction or piece of data in the very near future.</li>
                <li>It will soon access the instructions or data that are located near that piece of data, where “near” means an address whose numerical value is close to this one.</li>
            </ol>
                <li><strong>ROM:</strong> Read-only memory (ROM) is a type of non-volatile memory that stores data permanently. This information has been prerecorded during manufacture, 
                    which cannot be modified or removed, only fetched. ROM is used to hold important system instructions and data in a place where a user cannot accidentally or intentionally overwrite them.</li>

                <li><strong>memory cell size:</strong> The memory unit is made up of cells that contain a fixed number of binary digits, typically 8-bits per cell or 1 byte.</li>

                <li><strong>memory cell address:</strong>  Each memory cell is associated with units of unique identifier, which allowing the CPU to locate and accesses data stored at a specific location.</li>  

                <li><strong>register:</strong> This is a special high-speed storage cell that holds the operands of an arithmetic operation and that, when the operation is complete, holds its result.</li>

                <li><strong>fetch:</strong> This is process to retrieving or get data from memory and passing them to the control unit for decoding and execution.</li>    

                <li><strong>store:</strong> A process of saving data information in a storage or memory for future use.</li>   

                <li><strong>memory access time:</strong> This defined the time it takes for the computer's processors to carry out either a fetch or a store operation.</li>

                <li><strong>DASD:</strong> A direct access storage devices is refers to a mass storage devices in which every memory cell has a unique address, and it allows data to be accesses directly by its address, rather than sequentially.</li> 

                <li><strong>Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU):</strong> This is the subsystem that performs such mathematical and logical operations as addition, subtraction, and comparison for equality.</li> 

                <li><strong>Control Unit:</strong> This is a component of the computer's central processing unit, which fetch from memory the next instruction to be executed, 
                    decode it, and execute it by issuing the appropriate command to 
                    the ALU, memory, or I/O controllers.</li>

                <li><strong>Systems software:</strong> Is a collection of computer programs that manage the resources of a computer and facilitates access to those resources. This contrasts with application software that allows a user to address some specialized task of interest to that user, 
                    for example, write a document, create an image, browse the web, or solve a system of equations.</li>      

                <li><strong>user interface:</strong> A modern operating systems with a graphical user interface (GUI) that gives the user an intuitive visual overview as well as graphical control of the capabilities and services of the computer. 
                    Control of the GUI is typically done with keystrokes, mouse clicks, finger taps, voice activation, or biometric scans such as fingerprints.</li>

                <li><strong>language services:</strong> This is called assemblers, compilers, and interpreters, allow you to write programs in a high-level, user-oriented language rather than the machine language and to execute these programs easily and efficiently. 
                    They often include components such as text editors and debuggers.</li>

                <li><strong>memory managers:</strong> These programs allocate memory space for programs and data and retrieve this memory space when it is no longer needed.</li>

                <li><strong>i/o managers:</strong> These software packages allow you to easily and efficiently use the many different types of input and output devices that 
                    exist on a modern computer system.</li>

                <li><strong>scheduler:</strong> This system program keeps a list of programs ready to run on the processor, and it selects the one that will execute next. The scheduler 
                    allows you to have several different programs active at a single time, for instance, surfing the web while you are waiting for a file to finish printing.</li>
                    
                <li><strong>assembly language:</strong> These were termed second-generation languages to distinguish them from machine languages, which were viewed as first-generation languages.</li>
