                <li><strong>What is the purpose of a model?</strong> The purpose of a model is to provide a simplified representation for studying many physical and social phenomena. Weather systems, climate cycles, the spread of epidemics, population demographics, and chemical molecules—all are phenomena that have been studied via modeling.</li>

                <li><strong>List four phenomena of a model: </strong><br />
                    a. Captures the essence—the important properties—of the real thing;
                    <br />
                    b. Probably differs in scale from the real thing;
                    <br />
                    c. Omits some of the details of the real thing; and
                    <br />
                    d. Lacks the full functionality of the real thing.
                </li>
               
                <li><strong>List four characteristics of an algorithm:</strong><br />
                    a. Be a well-ordered collection
                    <br />
                    b. Consist of unambiguous and effectively computable operations;
                    <br />
                    c. Halt in a finite amount of time; and
                    <br />
                    d.  Produce a result.
                </li>

                <li><strong>List four things a computing agent should be able to do:</strong><br />
                    a. Accept input.
                    <br />
                    b. Store information in memory and retrieve it from memory.
                    <br />
                    c. Take actions according to algorithm instructions; the choice of what action to take may depend on the present state of the computing agent, as well as on the input item presently being processed.
                    <br />
                    d. Produce output.
                </li>

                <li><strong> What is the "halting problem" with regards to an uncomputable problem?</strong> The halting problem is defined whether a given program will eventually stop or run into an infinite loop. No program can be written to decide whether any given program al ways stops eventually, no matter what the input; No program can be written to decide whether any two programs are equivalent; No program can be written to decide whether any given program run on any given input will ever produce some specific output.</li>

                <li><strong>scientific method:</strong> This is a systematic process of observing the behavior of a system, formulating a hypothesis that tries to understand and explain that behavior, and designing experiments to test the hypothesis, it then analyzes the results to determine whether they support or disprove it. This is the fundamental way of gaining new scientific knowledge and understanding.</li>
                <li><strong>computational model:</strong> This meaning a model constructed using a set of mathematical equations and/or algorithmic procedures that capture the fundamental properties and behaviors of a system. It is also referred to as a computer simulation, used to study complex systems and improve the behavior of existing systems.</li>
                <li><strong> discrete event simulation:</strong> It is a modeling method that is relatively easy to understand and does not require a lot of complex mathematics. Instead of model time as continuous; like the falling body model in the last section, time is modeled as discrete. That is, the behavior of a system is represented only at an explicit and finite set of times.</li>
                <li><strong>List and describe seven reasons to construct a simulation model:</strong> <br /> 
                    Existence—The system might not yet exist, so it is not possible to experiment directly on the actual system. In fact, we might be using a model to help us with the construction of the system. 
                    <br /> <br />
                    Physical realization—The system is not constructed from entities that can be represented by physical objects. For example, it may be a social system (such as welfare policies or labor practices) that can only be simulated on a computer.
                    <br /> <br />
                    Safety—It might be too dangerous to experiment on the actual system or a physical replica. For example, you would not want to try out a new monetary policy that could economically devastate a population or build a nuclear reactor using a new and unproven technology.
                    <br /> <br />
                    Speed of construction—It might take too much time to construct a physical model. Sometimes it is faster to design and build a computer simulation.
                    <br /> <br />
                    Time scale—Some physical systems change too slowly or too quickly. For example, an elementary particle in a high-speed accelerator may decompose in 10215 seconds. At the other end of the time scale, some 
                    ecosystems take thousands of years to react to a modification. A simulation can easily model fractions of a second or billions of years because time is simply a parameter in an equation.
                    <br /> <br />
                    Ethical behavior—Some physical models have serious moral and ethical consequences, perhaps the best known being the use of animals in medical research. In this case, a computational model could eliminate a great deal of suffering.
                    <br /> <br />
                    Ease of modification—If we are not happy with the design of a physical model, we need to construct a brand-new one. In a simulation, we only need to change some numerical parameters and rerun the existing model.

                <li><strong>What is Illustris?</strong> Illustris is one of the most detailed and realistic computer simulation ever built to study the formation of the universe.</li>

                <li><strong>What fields of science were involved in the Illustris computational model?</strong> The fields of science involved in the Illustris computational model include physics, astronomy, hydrodynamics, chemistry, and mathematics.</li>

                <li><strong>What does Illustris simulate?</strong> Illustris simulate the expansion of galaxies, the gravitational pull of matter, the formation of stars and black holes, and the motions of cosmic gases.</li>

                <li><strong>How long did the project take?</strong> The project took five years for the software teams in the United States, France, and Germany to design, program, and test Illustris.</li>
                <li><strong>How many years of gallactic evolution are simulated in Illustris?</strong> Illustris simulates about 13.8 billion years of galactic evolution, or approximately 14 billion years.</li>

                <li><strong>Illustris was created using two supercomputers. What is a supercomputer?</strong> A supercomputer is an exceptionally powerful computer that can perform complex calculations and process massive amounts of data at incredibly high speeds. It is designed to tackle the most demanding computational tasks, 
                            from weather forecasting to scientific simulations and artificial intelligence (AI) research. Supercomputers are built with specialized hardware and software configurations, enabling them to handle parallel processing and deliver unparalleled performance. 
                            The two supercomputers used to create Illustris are the Curie supercomputer at CEA in France and the SuperMUC supercomputer at the Leibniz Computing Centre in Germany.
