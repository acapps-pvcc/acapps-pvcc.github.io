                <li><b>Explain why natural language is not an effective tool for describing algorithms:</b> These are because if we use natural language, 
                       then our algorithms would read much the same as a term paper or an essay; which can be extremely verbose, causing the resulting algorithms to be rambling, unstructured, and hard to follow. The lack of structure makes it difficult for the reader to locate specific sections of the algorithm.
                       Also, the problem is that natural language is too “rich” in interpretation and meaning, which makes it difficult to separate the logic key steps, and loops.</li>

                       Karl Friedrich Gauss's mathematical abilities include fundamental results in number theory, which he introduction of modular arithmetic, a system in which numbers “wrap around” after reaching a certain value. Algebra, with its fundamental theorem of algebra.
                       It states that every polynomial equation with real or complex coefficients has as many roots. In addition, He made numerous contributions, such as the composition law, proved the law of quadratic reciprocity, and the triangular case of the Fermat polygonal number theorem.
                       In terms of Karl Friedrich Gauss's scientific achievements include he invented an early type of magnetometer, a device that measures the direction and strength of a magnetic field. His practical work also led to the invention of the heliotrope in 1821. Gauss also developed a consistent system of magnetic units, 
                       and with Wilhelm Weber built one of the first electromagnetic telegraphs in 1833.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Describe Karl Frederich Gauss' algorithm for adding up the numbers from 1 to 100:</b> Karl Frederich Gauss’s algorithm for adding 1 to 100 is the sum of the first number and the last number, 1 and 100, which is 101. 
                       And so was the sum of the second and second-to-last numbers, 2 and 99. Gauss realized that this applied to all 100 numbers. And since 50 such pairs existed, all he needed to do was multiply 101 by 50 to get 5050, the correct answer.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>What are gaussian optics?</b> Gaussian optics is a technique in geometrical optics that describes the behaviour of light rays in optical systems by using the paraxial approximation, in which only rays which make small angles with the optical axis of the system are considered.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>What is a "gaussian blur" and how is it used in digital image editing?</b> Gaussian Blur is a filtering technique that uses a Gaussian function to create a smoothing effect on an image. The blur reduces image noise and reduces detail by averaging pixel values with their neighbors.</li>
