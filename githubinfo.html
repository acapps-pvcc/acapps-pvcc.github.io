        <li><strong>Q. What is a version control system?</strong>
            <span class="answer">
                <span class="letter_label">A.</span> A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool used in software development and collaborative projects to track and manage changes to source code.
            </span>
        </li>
         
        <li><strong>Q. What is Git?</strong>
            <span class="answer">
                <span class="letter_label">A.</span> Git is a tool used to keep track of changes to files, especially the code in projects. 
            It is termed a distributed version control system because of its behavior to allow multiple people to work on the same project, even if they are not connected to a common server.
            </span>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Q. What is GitHub?</strong>
            <span class="answer">
                <span class="letter_label">A.</span> GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories, providing  developers with tools to create, store, manage, collaborate, and share their code. 
            It leverages Git, an open-source version control system created by Linus Torvalds, to facilitate distributed version control, access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.
            </span>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Q. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?</strong>
            <span class="answer">
                <span class="letter_label">A.</span> The difference between Git and GitHub is that Git is software designed to track changes in source code. 
            It operates locally on the system, it is a command-line tool and does not require an internet connection. Also, Git is maintained by Linux and is focused on version control and code sharing. 
            GitHub, on the other hand, is a cloud-based platform that is a hosting service for Git repositories, which features a graphical user interface; requires an internet connection and is maintained by Microsoft.
            </span>
        </li>

       <li><strong>Q. Who started GitHub and how was it started?</strong>
            <span class="answer">
                <span class="letter_label">A.</span> GitHub was started by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, and Scott Chacon. GitHub started from the need for a more collaborative and user-friendly platform built on top of Git, the distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds.
            </span>
       </li>

       <li><strong>Q. What company owns it now?</strong>
            <span class="answer">
                <span class="letter_label">A.</span> GitHub is now owned by Microsoft.
            </span>

       </li>
    
       <li><strong>Q. How much does a GitHub account cost?</strong>
             <span class="answer">
                <span class="letter_label">A.</span> A GitHub account is free for individuals and organizations, the team plan costs $4 per user/month and includes advanced collaboration features.
           The enterprise plan costs $21 per user/month that includes security, compliance, and flexible deployment.
             </span>
       </li>

       <li><strong>Q. What is the Octocat?</strong>
             <span class="answer">
                <span class="letter_label">A.</span> Octocat is GitHub's official mascot, a playful and iconic figure that has become synonymous with the platform. It represents developers and symbolizes innovation, collaboration, 
           and the spirit of the tech industry.

    <h2>Git/GitHub terms:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>repository:</strong> This is a central location where developers store, manage, and collaborate on their code and related files.</li>
        
        <li><strong>commit:</strong> It represents a saved snapshot of changes to a repository. It's a fundamental unit of version control, acting as a historical record of modifications made to a project's files.</li>
        
        <li><strong>fork:</strong> It gives people the ability to create a personal copy of someone else's project under your GitHub account. 
            Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.</li>
        
        <li><strong>push:</strong> A command that allows us to transfer files from the local repository to the remote repository. This process essentially uploads your local work to a centralized location, such as a repository hosted on GitHub.</li>
        
        <li><strong>pull requests:</strong> A pull request (PR) is a mechanism in GitHub feature that allows developers to propose changes from one branch to another, enabling collaboration, code review, and discussion before merging changes into the main branch.</li>
        
        <li><strong>workflows:</strong> It is a configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs. Workflows are defined by a YAML file checked in to your repository and will run when triggered by an event in your repository, 
            or they can be triggered manually, or at a defined schedule.</li>
        
        <li><strong>issues:</strong> A feature provided by GitHub to help developers and teams track tasks, bugs, feature requests, or any work related to a project. 
            It serves as a centralized system for managing and organizing project-related discussions and progress.</li>
       
        <li><strong>raw button:</strong> When viewing a specific file within a repository, it provides access to the unprocessed, unstyled content of that file.</li>

        <li><strong>blame button:</strong> This command helps developers identify who made specific changes to a file. It annotates each line in a file with information about the last commit that modified the line, including the commit hash,
             the author, the date of the change, and optionally, the line number.</li>
