                       realizations, and their applications.</li>

                <li><b>algorithm:</b> A procedure for solving a mathematical problem in 
                    a finite number of steps that frequently involves repetition of an opera

                <li><b>sequential operation:</b> A sequential instruction carries out a single well
                    defined task. When that task is finished, the algorithm moves on to the 
                    next operation. Sequential operations are usually expressed as simple 
                    declarative sentences.</li>

                <li><b>conditional operation:</b> Are the “question-asking” instructions of 
                    an algorithm. They ask a question, and the next operation is then selected 
                    on the basis of the answer to that question</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>iterative operation:</b> Are the "looping" instructions of an algorithm. insted of go to the next instruction 
                    it go back repeat the execution of a previous block of instructions.</li>

                <li><b>integrated circuit:</b> With transistors, resistors, and capacitors were photographically etched 
                    onto a piece of silicon, which further reduced the size and cost of computers</li>

                <li><b>Fourth generation computer:</b> This generation introduced the first microcomputer using very-large-scale integrated circuits that have advanced to a single circuit board that could be advanced hand. 
                       It also included further reduction in size and cost, increased reliability, and included new graphical user interfaces with pull-down menus, icons.</li>
